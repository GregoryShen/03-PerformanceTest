## Help! My boss wants me to load test our web app!

This is a fairly open-ended proposition. There are a number of questions to be asked first, and additionally a number of resources that will be needed. You will need some hardware to run the benchmarks/load-tests from. A number of tools will prove useful. There are a number of products to consider. And finally, why is Java a good choice to implement a load-testing/Benchmarking product.

### Questions to ask

What is our anticipated average number of users (normal load)?

What is our anticipated peak number of users?

When is a good time to load-test our application (i.e. off-hours or week-ends), bearing in mind that this may very well crash one or more of our servers?

Does our application have state? If so, how does our application manage it(cookies, session-rewriting, or some other method)?

What is the testing intended to achieve?

### Resources

The following resources will prove very helpful. Bear in mind that if you cannot locate these resources, you will become these resources. As you already have your work cut out for you, it is worth knowing who the following people are, so that you can ask them for help if you need it.

#### Network

Who knows our network topology? If you run into any firewall or proxy isssues, this will become very important. A well, a private testing network (which will therefore have very low network latency) would be a very nice thing. Knowing who can set one up for you (if you feel that this is necessary) will be very useful. If the application doesn’t scale as expected, who can add additional hardware?

#### Application

Who knows how our application functions? The normal sequence is 

* test(low-volume - can we benchmark our application?)
* benchmark ( the average number of users)
* load-test  (the maximum number of users)
* test destructively (what is our hard limit?)

The test process may progress from black-box testing to white-box testing (the difference is that the first requires no knowledge of the application while the second requires some knowledge of the application). It is not uncommon to discover problems with the application during this process, so be prepared to defend your work.

###  What platform should I use to run the benchmarks/load-tests?

This should be a widely-used piece of hardware, with a standard (i.e. vanilla) software installation. Remember, if you publish your results, the fist thing your clients will do is hire a gradute student to verify them. You might as well make it as easy for this person as you possibly can.

For Windows, Windows XP Perfessional should be a minimum (the others do not multi-thread past 50-60 connections, and you probably anticipate more users than that).

Good free platforms include the linuxes, the BSDs, and Solaris Intel. If you have a little more money, there are commercial linuxes. This may be worth it if you need the support.

For non-Windows platforms, investigate “`ulimit -n unlimited`” with a view to including it in your user account startup scripts(.bashrc or .cshrc)
